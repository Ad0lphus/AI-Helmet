# AI- Smart Helmet

## 1.ABSTRACT:
The maintenance of a state of wakefulness while performing various tasks is needed for a range of reasons varying from safety to efficient performance and beyond. In order to decrease the possibility of accidents, alertness while operating vehicles, such as automobiles or heavy machinery, must be maintained. Additionally, reading and studying require wakefulness.
	This project is based on GSM as a smart helmet for automobile and truck drivers for an alertness alarm signal

## 2.OBJECTIVE:
The aim of this project is to develop a smart helmet to protect human from accident in case of drowsiness or while attending phone call in vehicle.

## 4.METHODOLOGY:
This project is developed to reduce and save the humans from accidents and to send the information about the person who is wearing the helmet to the caretaker using GSM module. This project contains three sensors ,Tilt sensor, gas sensor and touch sensor to detect accident. After sensing those parameter depending on the scenario the GSM module will take appropriate action. The main modules in this project are Sensors (touch sensor, gas sensor  and tilt sensor), GSM module with LCD display and output device. This transmitter model is placed in Helmet and receiver will there with caretaker.  This model has three Sensors as an input device to sense the mobile, tilt, gas and touch depending on the parameter measured the controller will take appropriate action.  The same information will be send to the caretaker via GSM. The receiver will activates the outputs to indicate a sensor has detected a signal the owner has to take appropriate action.

##  5.APPLICATIONS:
This project can be used for all kinds of two wheeler.
Further this project can be used to eliminate key-lock arrangement altogether.
This project can also be implemented in a confined area / geological area, so as to restrict the movement of vehicle including two-wheelers.
This project is very useful for the confidential meetings, secret occasions and other similar requirements.
Near the petrol Pumps, LPG Storages & Explosive Storage Places to prevent any possible damage due to the Cell Phone / GSM frequency, which may trigger explosion.
In the military Camps, Defense establishments etc to prevent the information leaking.
The cell phone may cause malfunctioning of the Bio-Medical Equipment. So this project can be used in the hospitals to detect the active mobile device.

## 6.CONCLUSION:
As this project is based on micro-controller and this can be of great use to develop a smart helmet to protect human from accident in case of drowsiness or while attending phone call in vehicle .
